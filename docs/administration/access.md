## Accessing the Admin Section

Upon Successful login to the OESS UI, if a user has Administrator
priviledges (they are a member of a workgroup that is marked as
administrator) A button on the top right of the page will be displayed
called "Admin".  The Admin button is available from all pages inside
of the OESS application, and is the gateway to make system level
modifications.
