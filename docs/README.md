The docs are divided to four main sections.

- the-basics (introduction)
- user-documentation
- operations-manual
- administration

Each section has both a main page and a directory containing all
sub-pages.

## Navigation

Each section has an associated directory in _data with a
`navigation.yml` file. This file lists the sub-pages of each section
and is used to generate the navigation for each section.

The links on each section's main page is **not** auto-generated and
must be maintained manually. This allows for entering generic info
about each section.
